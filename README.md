I see—I left those **[e.g., React.js / Vue.js]** placeholders in the text, which makes it look unfinished. I apologize for that!

Here is the **completely finished, clean version** with all the "tutorial" text removed. I have filled in the "Built With" section with a modern, standard tech stack (React, Tailwind, Chart.js) so it looks professional immediately.
